# eslint-typescript-vue-2-object-reactivity

These rules aim to solve the problem with Vue 2 Object Reactivity.
See these:
- https://github.com/Maxim-Mazurok/vue-2-vuex-object-reactivity
- https://github.com/Maxim-Mazurok/vue-3-vuex-object-reactivity
- https://github.com/Maxim-Mazurok/vue-2-vuex-object-reactivity-typescript - will be used to test this rule

This will only work with TypeScript because we need to know that we're dealing with `Vuex.Store`.
